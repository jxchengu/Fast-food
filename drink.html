        <h1>Drinks</h1>
        <p>Drinks are a key component of the fast-food experience, often defining a brand as much as its food. While soda fountains are standard, many chains have created their own signature beverages that have become iconic. </p>

            <h2>Taco Bell Baja Blast</h2>
            <p>Mountain Dew Baja Blast is one of the most famous fast-food exclusive drinks, known for its vibrant turquoise color and unique tropical lime flavor. The drink was first introduced in 2004 as a collaboration between PepsiCo and Taco Bell and was only available at their restaurants. Its distinct flavor and limited availability created a dedicated fan base and a cult following, with many customers going to Taco Bell specifically to get the drink. The overwhelming popularity eventually led to its release in bottles and cans in retail stores, though it remains a staple of the Taco Bell menu.</p>

            <h2>Dunkin'</h2>
            <p>Dunkin's Iced Coffee is a hugely popular item on their menu, known for its consistent flavor and quick preparation. Unlike many coffee shops, which brew hot coffee and then chill it, Dunkin's iced coffee is prepared using a cold brewing process. This method helps reduce the acidity and bitterness of the coffee, resulting in a smoother and more mellow flavor profile. It's often customized with a wide variety of syrups, flavor shots, and creams, making it a staple for millions of daily commuters and a key part of the brand's identity.</p>

            <h2>Raising Canes Sweet Tea</h2>
            <p>In contrast to Zaxby's Sweet Tea, Raising Cane's Sweet Tea is equally famous among its fans, but it's known for its freshly brewed, simple flavor. The company often highlights its dedication to making the tea in-house with its own proprietary blend, and its clean taste is a staple that perfectly complements its chicken fingers.</p>
