            <p>The history of McDonald's began in 1940 when brothers Richard and Maurice McDonald opened their first restaurant in San Bernardino, California. They pioneered the "Speedee Service System" in 1948, focusing on a limited menu and a streamlined, assembly-line-style process to ensure speed and efficiency. This innovative approach laid the groundwork for the modern fast-food industry.</p>
            <p>The Big Mac, one of McDonald's most famous creations, was not a corporate invention. It was created in 1967 by Jim Delligatti, a franchise owner in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He wanted to offer a larger, more filling sandwich to compete with a rival's popular burger. The unique three-part bun and "special sauce" were an instant success, and the burger was added to the national menu in 1968, becoming a symbol of the brand worldwide. Its unique flavor profile comes from the sweet and tangy "special sauce," which blends harmoniously with the crisp lettuce, zesty pickles, and savory beef.</p>
            <p>Following the success of the Big Mac, another franchise owner, Al Bernardin, developed the Quarter Pounder. Introduced in 1971, this burger was designed for customers who wanted a more substantial, meat-focused sandwich. Its appeal was its simplicity and a focus on a single, juicy, quarter-pound patty. This burger offered a different experience from the complex Big Mac, showcasing McDonald's ability to cater to different tastes while maintaining its commitment to a consistent, quality burger.</p>

            <h1>Burger King</h1>

            <img src="C:\Users\kai_k\Downloads\vegan-plant-based-burger-king-1024x576.jpg" alt="whopper">
            <p>Burger King was founded in 1953 as "Insta-Burger King" in Jacksonville, Florida. After facing financial difficulties, it was purchased by its Miami-based franchisees, James McLamore and David Edgerton, who renamed it Burger King. They built the company on the principle of offering higher-quality, larger burgers, and the unique flame-grilling method quickly became the central pillar of its identity. This commitment to its signature cooking process and customer customization has defined Burger King's brand for decades.</p>
            <p>The Whopper, a flagship product of Burger King, was introduced in 1957 by founder James McLamore. He saw a need for a larger, more satisfying burger than those offered by competitors. The Whopper's name was chosen to convey its size and "whopper of a burger" appeal.</p>
            <p>What sets the Whopper apart is its flame-grilled patty, a cooking method that Burger King has used to define its brand. This technique gives the beef a distinctive smoky flavor, which has become a key point of differentiation from its rivals. The classic Whopper consists of a quarter-pound flame-grilled beef patty, tomatoes, lettuce, mayonnaise, ketchup, pickles, and sliced white onions on a sesame seed bun.</p>

            <h1>Wendy's</h1>

            <p class="wendy">Wendy's was founded by Dave Thomas in 1969 in Columbus, Ohio. Thomas, a veteran of the fast-food industry, had a vision for a quality-focused burger chain that offered fresh, never-frozen beef. This commitment to quality was a core principle from the beginning and remains a key part of the brand's identity today. Thomas also pioneered the use of the "pick-up window," a feature that later became a standard in the fast-food industry.</p>
            <p class="wendy">The Baconator is one of Wendy's most well-known burgers, a creation that lives up to its name by putting bacon at the absolute center of its identity. Introduced in 2007, the burger is built around two beef patties, which are topped with six strips of bacon, two slices of American cheese, mayonnaise, and ketchup. Its appeal is rooted in its unapologetic richness and savory flavor, with the salty, crispy bacon providing a dominant taste and texture. The Baconator is a testament to Wendy's commitment to building a burger that delivers a bold, indulgent experience.</p>
            <p class="wendy">In contrast to the Baconator's over-the-top design, Dave's Single is a more classic and foundational offering. Named after Wendy's founder, Dave Thomas, this burger is a core part of the menu and a reflection of the company's long-standing promise of fresh, never-frozen beef. It's built with a single, square beef patty, topped with American cheese, crisp lettuce, tomato, pickles, onions, ketchup, and mayonnaise on a toasted bun. The burger's taste is defined by the quality of the fresh beef and the simple, balanced combination of its toppings, making it a staple for those who appreciate a straightforward yet high-quality burger experience.</p>

            <h1>In N Out</h1>

            <img src="C:\Users\kai_k\Downloads\secret-in-n-out-menu-items-1.jpg" alt="in n out">
            <p>In-N-Out Burger was founded in 1948 by Harry and Esther Snyder in Baldwin Park, California. The company began as a small drive-thru stand, but from the beginning, the Snyders' philosophy was simple: offer a limited menu of high-quality, fresh food. They pioneered the two-way speaker system for ordering, which allowed them to serve customers without them having to leave their cars. This focus on quality ingredients and customer convenience laid the foundation for the company's dedicated following and enduring success, as it expanded slowly but steadily throughout the West Coast.</p>
            <p>The restaurant's core appeal lies in its famously simple menu. Unlike many fast-food chains that constantly introduce new items, In-N-Out has maintained a straightforward offering: the Hamburger, Cheeseburger, and the iconic Double-Double, which features two beef patties and two slices of cheese. The burgers are made with fresh, never-frozen beef, and the French fries are cut from whole potatoes and cooked in 100% vegetable oil. This unwavering commitment to freshness and a consistent, no-frills menu has made In-N-Out a classic in the fast-food world.</p>
            <p>The quality of In-N-Out's ingredients is a hallmark of its brand. The beef is a hundred percent pure beef, free of additives, and is ground and formed into patties daily. The vegetables, including the hand-leafed lettuce and vine-ripened tomatoes, are delivered fresh to each location. A key component of the burgers' unique flavor is the signature "spread," a tangy and creamy Thousand Island-style sauce. This combination of fresh beef, crisp vegetables, and distinctive sauce, all served on a freshly baked toasted bun, creates a consistent and celebrated taste profile.</p>
            <p>In-N-Out is also famous for its "Not-So-Secret Menu," a collection of popular customizations that have become part of the company's lore. The most well-known of these is "Animal Style," which can be applied to both burgers and fries. An "Animal Style" burger includes a mustard-cooked patty, extra spread, pickles, and grilled onions. "Protein Style" is another popular choice, where the bun is replaced with a hand-leafed lettuce wrap. For those with a bigger appetite, customers can order a "3x3" or a "4x4," referring to the number of patties and slices of cheese on the burger.</p>

            <img src="C:\Users\kai_k\Downloads\shake.jpg" alt="shake">
            <p>Shake Shack began as a single hot dog cart in New York City's Madison Square Park in 2004. Created by Danny Meyer's Union Square Hospitality Group, it was conceived as a way to support the park's first art installation. The simple stand quickly became a sensation, with people lining up for its gourmet hot dogs and burgers. Its initial success led to the opening of its first permanent kiosk in 2004 and marked the beginning of its transformation from a temporary art project into a global, publicly-traded company known for its "fine-casual" dining experience.</p>
            <p>The core of Shake Shack's menu is its signature ShackBurger, which features a single or double patty of 100% all-natural Angus beef, free from hormones and antibiotics. The burgers are known for their fresh, never-frozen quality and are served on a soft, toasted potato bun. In addition to its burgers, the chain is famous for its crispy crinkle-cut fries and its unique frozen custard, which is used to create rich and decadent milkshakes and "Concretes," a dense blend of frozen custard and various mix-ins.</p>

            <p>Whataburger was founded in 1950 by Harmon Dobson and Paul Burton in Corpus Christi, Texas. Dobson's goal was ambitious yet simple: to create a burger so large and flavorful that it would make customers exclaim, "What a burger!" The original A-frame orange and white building was designed to be easily recognizable from a distance, and the commitment to fresh, made-to-order burgers quickly established a loyal following. Over the decades, Whataburger has expanded beyond its Texas roots to become a beloved institution across the Southern United States.</p>
            <p>The menu is centered on its flagship item, the Whataburger. This signature burger is known for its five-inch bun and a fresh, 100% pure beef patty that is cooked to order. It comes standard with mustard, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, and onions. Whataburger's dedication to customization is a key part of its appeal, allowing customers to add or remove toppings to create their perfect sandwich. The menu has since expanded to include other popular items like the Honey BBQ Chicken Strip Sandwich, the savory Patty Melt, and a full breakfast menu with unique offerings like Breakfast Taquitos.</p>

            <p>Subway was founded in 1965 by 17-year-old Fred DeLuca and family friend Dr. Peter Buck. Initially named "Pete's Super Submarines" in Bridgeport, Connecticut, the venture was started with a $1,000 loan to help DeLuca pay for college. The name was later changed to Subway, and the company quickly grew its presence by offering a made-to-order alternative to traditional fast food. The core of their business model was built on offering a customizable sandwich with fresh ingredients, a concept that would prove to be a global success.</p>
            <p>The Subway experience is defined by its build-your-own sandwich concept. Customers select their bread from various options like Italian or Wheat, and then choose from a range of meats, cheeses, vegetables, and sauces. This level of customization allows for a unique sandwich for every customer, catering to individual tastes and dietary needs. Popular menu items, such as the Italian B.M.T. and the Subway Club, are well-known, but the true appeal lies in the ability to create your own perfect sub from the extensive selection of fresh ingredients.</p>

            <p>Arby's was founded in 1964 by brothers Forrest and Leroy Raffel in Boardman, Ohio. At a time when hamburgers dominated the fast-food landscape, the Raffels had a vision for something different. They wanted to offer a sandwich that was of higher quality and stood apart from the competition. Their initial idea was to sell a roast beef sandwich, a concept that was relatively new to the quick-service restaurant industry. The name "Arby's" was a playful nod to their initials, R.B., for Raffel Brothers.</p>
            <p>The menu is built around its famous slow-roasted, thinly sliced roast beef sandwich. This flagship item is served on a sesame seed bun and is often paired with a choice of Arby's Sauce or Horsey Sauce, a creamy horseradish condiment. While the roast beef sandwich remains the core of the brand, the menu has expanded significantly over the years to include a variety of other meats, such as sliced turkey, corned beef, and chicken. The chain is also widely known for its distinct sides, most notably the seasoned and curly fries, and the unique Jamocha Shake, a blend of chocolate and coffee.</p>
